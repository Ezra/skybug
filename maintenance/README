ALTER TABLE scripts go into the sql directory (and ONLY those scripts go into the sql directory). It's good practice to make them idempotent, if possible.

These scripts are supposed to be immutable. Do not modify them, or you'll break EVERYTHING. Probably.

maintenance/run_sql needs to exist, modify it from maintenance/run_sql.template.
maintenance/update_from_to is the database updater that you can give a specific from and to commit ids.
maintenance/update updates maintains maintenance/local_db_version, which is a file ignored by git.

Normal usage is just to run maintenance/update after every pull. If you run maintenance/update_from_to, be sure to update maintenance/local_db_version correspondingly.

Our lack of using this from the start conspires nicely with the DROP TABLE IF EXISTS and REPLACE in sql/initial.sql.
